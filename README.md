# Convex-Optimization

The field of mathematical optimization that studies the problem of Optimizing the convex functions over the convex sets.<br>

<b>Definition</b>: A convex optimization problem is an [optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem) in which the objective function is a [convex function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function) and the [feasible set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region) in a [convex set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set).

We use *CVX* or *CVXPY* in Python to solve the optimization problems with appropriate objectives & constraints.<br>
While using in Python, install the *cvxpy* module to work with.

Install CVXPY using pip:
> pip3 install cvxpy

All the python codes are written in Jupyter Notebooks.
